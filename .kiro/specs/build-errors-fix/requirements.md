# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical compilation errors preventing the Flutter application from building successfully. The errors are primarily related to type mismatches, missing properties, and inconsistent model definitions across the notification system and profile completion components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flutter application to compile successfully, so that I can run and test the application without build errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the NotificationSyncManager SHALL use the correct NotificationModel constructor parameters
2. WHEN the application is built THEN the UserDataModel type SHALL be properly defined and imported
3. WHEN the application is built THEN the NotificationModel SHALL have consistent property names across all usages
4. WHEN the application is built THEN the ProfileCompletionView SHALL use the correct SyncStatus enum reference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent model definitions, so that there are no type conflicts between different parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NotificationModel is used THEN it SHALL have consistent property names (timestamp vs createdAt)
2. WHEN UserDataModel is referenced THEN it SHALL be properly imported and defined
3. WHEN SyncStatus is used THEN it SHALL be properly imported from the correct module
4. WHEN notification constructors are called THEN they SHALL use the correct parameter names

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for missing types, so that the application provides clear feedback when dependencies are not found.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UserDataModel is not found THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback or proper error handling
2. WHEN SyncStatus enum is not found THEN the system SHALL import it from the correct location
3. WHEN notification properties are accessed THEN they SHALL use the correct property names defined in the model
4. WHEN type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear compilation errors with suggested fixes
